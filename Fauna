  <h1 text-align="left">Fauna</h1>
   <p>Fauna is all of the animal life present in a particular region or time. The corresponding term for plants is flora.</p>
   <p>The various human activities have led to their extinction and made them Endangeres.</p>
   <h2>Endangered</h2>
   <p>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction.</p>
   <h3>5 most Endangered Fauna</h3>
   <h4>1.Gorillas</h4>
   <p>Gorillas are fascinating creatures that share 98.3% of their DNA with humans! They are capable of feeling emotions like we do and even behave like us sometimes. There are two species, the Eastern Gorilla and the Western Gorilla, and they both have two subspecies. Three out of four are Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The only one that isn’t is the Mountain Gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, which is considered Endangered.</p>

   <h4>2.Rhinos</h4>
   <p>The name Rhinocerous comes from two Greek words Rhino and Ceros, which when translated into English mean nose horn.They are used in Traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a status symbol and demonstration of wealth. They are so highly prized that a Javan rhino horn can sell for up to $30,000 per kg on the black market. Because of this, three of the five species of rhinoceros are among the most endangered species in the world: the black rhino, the Javan rhino, and the Sumatran rhino. The Javan rhino is the closest to extinction with only between 46 to 66 individuals left.</p>

   <h4>3.Sea Turtles</h4>
   <p> Two species of sea turtle are critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Hawksbill Turtles and Kemps Ridley Turtles. Leatherback sea turtles are classified as Vulnerable, though the population is decreasing and several subpopulations are facing extinction. </p>

   <h4>4.Saola</h4>
   <p>The Saola is one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. It was first discovered in 1992 in the Annamite Range in Vietnam.The Saola is one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. It was first discovered in 1992 in the Annamite Range in Vietnam.</p>

   <h4>5.North Atlantic right whale</h4>
   <p>It was whalers that gave the North Atlantic right whale its name. They are gentle giants that stay close to coasts and spend a lot of time at the surface skim feeding on zooplankton, all of which makes them an easy target and the ‘right whale to hunt'. There are currently only around 400 of them left, and only about 100 breeding females.</p>

   <h3>Reasons of Endangerement</h3>
   <p>The reasons for these species being Endangered are factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species.
   <h2>Extinct</h2>
   <p>
Extinction of a particular animal species occurs when there are no more individuals of that species alive anywhere in the world - the species has died out. This is a natural part of evolution.<br>

But sometimes extinctions happen at a much faster rate than usual. For example, at the end of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago, a mass extinction caused the death of many different types of animals and plants, including the dinosaurs.</p>
   <h3>5 Extinct Fauna</h3>
   <h4>1.Bramble Cay Melomys</h4>
   <p>These little guys were officially declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2015. Native to Bramble Cay, a small island near the northern side of the Great Barrier Reef, it's reported that the rodents haven't been spotted since way back in 2009.</p>

   <h4>2.The Northern White Rhinoceros</h4>
   <p>The last two living northern white rhino's in existence happen to both be female as the last male died in March of 2018. Sudan, the 45-year old male was under armed guard at Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy when he passed away from old age and an infection.

The two females are also unable to give birth, making the likelihood of introducing a new generation of the species highly unlikely. Scientists are working on using harvested sex cells and IVF to bring forth a lab-created northern white rhino.</p>

    <h4>3.The Spix Macaw</h4>
    <p>Thought to be extinct in the wild, the Spix Macaw currently exists in captivity with their numbers in the dismally low 60-80 range. The bird is also referred to as Little Blue Macaw because they're known for their vibrant blue feathers.</p>

    <h4>4.The Thylacine</h4>
    <p>The Thylacine, a carnivore also referred to as the Tasmanian tiger and Tasmanian wolf, was a (mostly) nocturnal marsupial that preyed on rodents and kangaroos.

Although Thylacine's looked fierce, they were actually quite timid and, according to Live Science, "could be captured without a fight." Reports of Thylacine sightings have been so frequent in the past century that it sparked an investigation as to the status of their existence.</p>

    <h4>5.The Passenger Pigeon</h4>
    <p>Estimates say that the passenger pigeon population numbered in the millions—and possibly billions—when the first Europeans began settling in America. MentalFloss reports that Wisconsin was home to largest known nesting site in the late 1800s</p>

    <h3>Reason for Extinction</h3>
    <p>Humans have caused the extinction of various species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences.</p>
